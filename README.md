# Image-scaler
## Name
Image-scaler

## Installation
Application made to test execution difference between ASM and C++ when calculating pixel values. 

## Authors and acknowledgment
me, myself and I

## Project status
Application doesn't work with every image type.
Some formats couses strange behavior and incorect output.
though I narrowed the problem to how image is moved between buffors,
possible sollution may require rewriting large part of code.
In the end program is able to show time differences so i don't bother fixing this.
